                                the current system established to control the hazards related to electricity. The electrical safety audit examines the safety &
                                security of the electrical insulations installed in any industry or organization. The electrical safety audit is conducted by the
                                experienced professionals which provides the necessary assistance to the organizations in reducing the risk related to
                                electricity & compliance to the safety standards.
